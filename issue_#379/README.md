## Interview question of the week

This week's question:
Given an array of integers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that determines the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and selling the stock once. If no profit can be made, return 0.

Examples:
```
maxTheStock([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4])
5 // (buy at 1, sell at 6)

maxTheStock([7, 6, 4, 3, 1])
0 // (no profit possible)
```
